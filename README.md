# Friday Night Funkin': NEO // RELOAD
A work in progress P-Slice port of Friday Night Funkin': NEO with extra features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Though base Psych Engine should work fine, it's highly reccomended you use the [P-Slice fork](https://github.com/Psych-Slice/P-Slice) to play this.

## Plans
* Add NEO Boyfriend as a playable character to lessen bloat in the Freeplay menu 
* Rechart every song, adding an OG difficulty to preserve the original charts
* Add achievements using Psych's achievement system
* Implement instrumental switching, with edited instrumentals to ensure compatability
